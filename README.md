I am a self-motivated and curious Full Stack Junior Developer, looking for a role which will expand my knowledge in full stack development and provide a supportive environment which values engineering best practices.

Before falling in love with coding and completing Makers Academy, I worked as a personal assistant and office manager for 6 years in various industries, including the health, education and charity sectors, supporting CEOs and Directors achieve their goals. Highly motivated by cause, I also volunteered as a youth mentor and team leader for 9 years, balancing a full-time career with a passion to see increased opportunities for young people across London.

As a highly analytical and logical person, retraining as a developer was an opportunity I could not pass up. I have loved every second of the journey and look forward to digging my teeth into new problem solving challenges and project builds.

## Skills

#### Quick Study

Having managed various offices and the professional lives of leaders, learning new databases, systems and best practices at speed has been a necessity. Most recently, in my role at St Paul's Girls' School, I managed a school-wide migration to CPOMS (secure online monitoring software) for tracking all pastoral needs/incidents and oversaw the daily registration of 550+ pupils on iSAMS (school management information system). Acclimatising to new environments, standards, and technologies has become second nature. During our final project at Makers, we were able, as a team, to teach ourselves React Native within a week to deliver the core functionality of our food app. I was also able to deliver the app's styling in less than two days, by learning and utilising Supernova.io software.

#### Project Management

In my role at American Medical Systems, I was responsible for the complete shutting down of an office as the company merged with Boston Scientific. This involved a year long project management strategy: liaising with all suppliers, transitioning all the functions to the new parent company’s office to strict deadlines, and inducting staff from the new company on systems, troubleshooting issues as they arose and liaising with senior staff on potential business continuity issues as they arose or could be identified.

#### Excellent Communicator

I have practised strong communication skills across my previous career, from facilitating and supporting the Board of Trustees at Y Care International to writing and issuing departmental memos to 2000+ parents at St Paul's Girls' School. I have become adept at communicating effectively and professionally with various stakeholders across the board, including customers (in the form of doctors, parents, the general public and more), senior leadership, team members and collaborative pairs. This has heavily informed my work at Makers, to ensure smooth, empathetic and careful communication when pair programming or working in teams, as well as ensuring that documentation (such as READMEs) is kept up-to-date and relevant.

#### Attention to Detail


#### Strong Prioritisation and Time Management

I have often found myself juggling the needs of several teams with the demands of senior management, requiring some strict prioritisation and time boxing. I love rising to the challenge of a high pressured environment, managing expectations, troubleshooting issues as they arise and delivering positive outcomes.
